The function that generates the number has been added to Class Library and it is added as a 
reference in the console application


The exe file and the dll file has been given

The function in the class library has the following parameters

1. The limit - upper bound to which the number needs to be printed
2. Key value pairs of what word to be printed when divisible by what number (any number of arguments can be given)

The key value pair must be passed like this:
new KeyValuePair<int, string>(2, "hi"), new KeyValuePair<int, string>(Number to be divisible, Word it has to print)



The test case is 15 numbers and when divisible by 2 it prints hi, when divisible by 3 prints fizz, when divisible by 5 prints buzz

And when divisible by 2 ( &||) 3 (&||) 5
it combines the words
